# CasaAI - Generative AI Powered Architectural Plan Generation and 3D Visualization

Welcome to CasaAI's GitHub repository! This project leverages advanced generative AI models and 3D visualization techniques to revolutionize the architectural design process. CasaAI aims to provide personalized, eco-friendly, and efficient housing designs that cater to individual preferences while promoting environmental responsibility.

## Introduction

CasaAI integrates cutting-edge AI technology to generate architectural plans and visualize them in 3D. Users can input textual descriptions or images to create and customize architectural designs, which are then rendered in real-time 3D for an immersive experience.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Design Generation:**
  - Text-to-Image Generation using Stable Diffusion and LORA.
  - Image-to-Image Generation for consistent architectural designs.
  
- **3D Visualization:**
  - Edge detection with OpenCV.
  - SVG extrusion and rendering with three.js for interactive 3D models.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Intuitive front-end interface for design input and manipulation.
  
- **Sustainability and Efficiency:**
  - Optimization of space and resources in architectural plans.
